# Personalize macOS Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of personalizing your macOS environment using a set of modular scripts. The goal is to automate macOS setup and system optimizations while ensuring that key steps are manually handled by the user for full control and reliability.

## üöÄ Overview

This project includes a series of scripts designed to personalize the **appearance and functionality** of your macOS setup. By running these scripts, you will:

* Configure the **Dock** to be more minimal and efficient.
* Declutter and organize the **Menu Bar**.
* Tweak essential **Finder** settings.
* Optimize **System Settings** for a streamlined experience.
* Ensure macOS is **ready for development** with customized defaults.

### 2. **Restore Script** (`restore_macos_settings.sh`)

This script will allow you to restore the settings from the backup. It can be run manually if anything goes wrong during the personalization process.

This script:

* Asks the user to provide the path to a previous backup file.
* Restores the settings from that backup.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use the Scripts

### Step 1: Clone or Download the Repository

Clone the repository to your machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/personalize-macos.git
```

Alternatively, you can download the scripts as `.zip` and extract them to your desired directory.

### Step 1: Backup Your Settings (Optional, but recommended)

Before you proceed with personalizing macOS, run the **backup script** to save your current settings. This ensures you can restore your system to its original state if needed.

1. Open your **Terminal**.
2. Navigate to the directory where the scripts are located.
3. Run the **backup** script:

```bash
bash scripts/backup_macos_settings.sh
```


### Step 2: Run the Scripts

The main installation script (`install.sh`) will guide you through the entire process. This script will call the `macos_setup.sh` script, which in turn will execute each modular script. Follow the steps below:

1. Open your **Terminal**.
2. Navigate to the directory where the scripts are located.
3. Execute the main installation script:

```zsh
zsh setup/install.sh
```

### Step 3: Follow Manual Prompts

During the execution, you will be prompted to **complete manual tasks** between each personalization script. Once the tasks are completed, **press any key** to continue to the next script.

## üìù Important Notes

* **Restoring Settings**: If anything goes wrong, you can restore your previous settings by running the `restore_macos_settings.sh` script with the backup file path.
* **macOS Version**: These scripts are designed for **macOS Ventura+**. If you're using an older version, some features might not work as expected.
* **Admin Access**: Some commands may require **administrator privileges** (for example, changing energy saver settings). Ensure you have **sudo** access.
* **Revert Changes**: To revert any specific setting, you can manually edit `defaults` or use the System Settings app to adjust preferences.

---

## **Restore Your macOS Settings**

If you need to revert your macOS settings to their previous state, you can run the **restore script**:

```zsh
zsh setup/macos/restore_macos_settings.sh
```

You will be prompted to enter the path to the backup file that you created earlier. The script will then restore your macOS preferences from the backup.

## üîß Troubleshooting

* **Missing Settings or Features**: If you notice that some settings aren't applied or appear different, they might require a **macOS restart** to take full effect.
* **Permission Issues**: If a script fails to execute due to permissions, try running the script with elevated privileges:

  ```zsh
  sudo zsh setup/install.sh
  ```

## üöÄ Final Thoughts

By running these scripts, you'll have a fully personalized macOS environment tailored for development and a cleaner, more efficient workspace.
